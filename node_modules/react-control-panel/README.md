# control-panel

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
![experimental][experimental-image]

This is a React port of [`control-panel`](https://github.com/freeman-lab/control-panel) that aims to replicate the functionality of the original exactly while making it easily usable from React. All of the features of the original have been brought over, and the API remains very similar.

Embeddable panel of inputs for adding parameter selection to your app or visualization. Modern and minimalist design. Fully encapsulated module including JS and CSS. Can easily be added to any app or page. Heavily inspired by [`dat-gui`](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui), but streamlined, simplified, and written as a npm module.

**[`LIVE DEMO`](https://control-panel.ameo.design)**

> Supports the following input types

> `range` • `checkbox` • `text` • `color` • `button` • `interval` • `select` • `custom`

---

> Includes the following themes

> `dark` • `light`

## install

Add to your project with

```
npm install control-panel
```

The UI uses the Hack font which users may not have installed on their machines locally. To include a version dynamically, add the following line to your `<head>`:

```html
<style type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/font-hack/2.019/css/hack.min.css></style>
```

## example

Create a panel with four elements and add to your page in the top right.

```javascript
import ControlPanel, {
  Button,
  Checkbox,
  Multibox,
  Select,
  Text,
  Color,
  Range,
  Interval,
  Custom,
} from 'react-control-panel';

const initialState = {
  'range slider': 20,
  'stepped slider': 0.6,
  interval: [25, 50],
  text: 'my setting',
  checkbox: true,
  'color rgb': 'rgb(100, 200, 100',
  'color hex': '#30b2ba',
  selection: 'option 1',
  'multiple checkboxes': [true, true],
};

const DemoPanel = () => (
  <ControlPanel
    theme="dark"
    title="Demo Panel"
    initialState={initialState}
    onChange={console.log}
    width={500}
    style={{ marginRight: 30 }}
  >
    <Range label="range slider" min={0} max={100} />
    <Range label="stepped slider" min={0} max={1} />
    <Interval label="interval" min={0} max={100} />
    <Text label="text" />
    <Checkbox label="checkbox" />
    <Color label="color rgb" format="rgb" />
    <Color label="color hex" format="hex" />
    <Button label="gimme an alert" action={() => alert('clicked')} />
    <Select label="selection" options={{ 'option 1': 1, 'option 2': 2 }} />
    <Multibox label="multiple checkboxes" colors={['rgb(100,120,230)', 'rgb(210,100,190)']} names={['box1', 'box2']} />
    <Custom
      Comp={({ value, onChange, theme }) => <MyCustomComponent value={value} onChange={onChange} theme={theme} />}
    />
  </ControlPanel>
);
```

### classic setting definitions

It's also possible to use the old array-based definition system from the original version:

```javascript
<DemoPanel
  theme="dark"
  title="Array-Declared Control Panel"
  position="bottom-right"
  settings={[
    { type: 'range', label: 'my range', min: 0, max: 100, initial: 20 },
    { type: 'range', label: 'log range', min: 0.1, max: 100, initial: 20, scale: 'log' },
    { type: 'text', label: 'my text', initial: 'my cool setting' },
    { type: 'checkbox', label: 'my checkbox', initial: true },
    { type: 'color', label: 'my color', format: 'rgb', initial: 'rgb(10,200,0)' },
    {
      type: 'button',
      label: 'gimme an alert',
      action: () => {
        alert('hello!');
      },
      onmousedown: () => console.log('button pressed'),
      onmouseup: () => console.log('button released'),
    },
    {
      type: 'select',
      label: 'select one',
      options: ['option 1', 'option 2'],
      initial: 'option 1',
    },
    { type: 'multibox', label: 'check many', count: 3, initial: [true, false, true] },
  ]}
/>
```

## usage

The `ControlPanel` component takes an array of children setting components that all receive part of the state. They each take additional props that can be used to configure their behavior. The `ControlPanel` itself takes a variety of props itself:

- `initialState` is an object mapping label to initial value for each of the settings for the control panel. It is required, and a value should be supplied for each of the settings components.
- `onChange` accepts a callback that has the following signature: `(label, newValue, state)` where `state` is the full state object for the entire panel. The supplied function will be called every time that any of the settings are updated.
- `theme` can specify `light` • `dark` or provide an object (see [`themes.js`](themes.js) for format)
- `title` a title to add to the top of the panel
- `width` width of panel in pixels
- `position` where to place the panel as `top-left` • `top-right` • `bottom-left` • `bottom-right`, if `undefined` will just use relative positioning. An object containing absolute positioning in terms of offsets from the sides of the page can also supplied like `{ left: 8, top: 0 }` or `{ right: 200 }`.
- `draggable` makes the entire control panel draggable.
- `style` is an object of inline styles that will be merged into the default styles of the panel's main component.
- `settings` is an array of setting definitions in the same format as the orignal library; this can be used as an alternative to passing in setting components as children. See the `classic setting definitions` section above for an example.
- `state` is an external state object that will be used to replace the state maintained by the panel itself. For more info, see the `external state` section below.
- `contextCb` accepts a callback that will be provided with an object that can be used to get and set the inner state used by the panel directly. For more info, see the `panel context` section below.

Each child setting component must be one of `Range` • `Input` • `Checkbox` • `Color` • `Interval` • `Select`. Each `label` must be unique as it maps to a top-level key of the state object for the whole `ControlPanel`.

Some setting components have additional properties:

- Inputs of type `range` can specify a `min`, `max`, and `step` (or integer `steps`). Scale can be either `'linear'` (default) or `'log'`. If a log scale, the sign of `min`, `max`, and `initial` must be the same and only `steps` is permitted (since the step size is not constant on a log scale).
- Inputs of type `color` can specify a `format` as either `rgb` • `hex` • `array`
- Inputs of type `button` can specify `action` (onclick), `onmousedown`, and `onmouseup` callbacks. Button inputs are not reflected in the state and do not trigger an `'input'` event.
- Inputs of type `interval` obey the same semantics as `range` inputs, except the input and output is a two-element array corresponding to the low/high bounds, e.g. `initial: [1, 7.5]`.
- Inputs of type `select` can specify a list of options, either as an `Array` (in which case the value is the same as the option text) or as an object containing key/value pairs (in which case the key/value pair maps to value value/label pairs).
- Inputs of type `multibox` can specify a number of checkboxes, either by providing a `count` or a list of `names` from which the number will be inferred, in which case the color of each box and a text name can also be provided as lists `colors` and `names`
- Inputs of type `custom` can specify a custom component to be rendered in place of the input. The custom component will be supplied `value`, `onChange`, and `theme` props from the control panel. An additional `renderContainer` prop can be used to disable rendering a `Container` around the custom `Comp` if it is set to `false`.

### external state

It is sometimes desirable to hoist the state for a panel up into something like Redux rather than letting the component handle it itself. This is supported by passing a `state` prop into the `ControlPanel` which you are in charge of keeping updated with new values provided by the panel's `onChange` prop callback. Here's an example of how this would work with state hoisted into a parent component:

```js
class Wrapper extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      label1: 'val',
      ...
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ControlPanel
        state={this.state}
        {/* \/ not necessary - this is inferred automatically when `state` is provided */}
        {/*initialState={this.state}*/}
        onChange={(key, val) => this.setState({ [key]: val })}
        title='Panel with External State'
      />
        ...
    </ControlPanel>
    );
  }
}
```

Please note that panel context will not work if you use external state.

### panel context

As mentioned above, it's possible to pass a callback to the `ControlPanel` component which will be supplied with a special context object after the component has mounted. This allows the underlying state to be directly viewed and manipulated from other parts of the application while still being reflected dynamically in the UI. Here's an example:

```javascript
const handleContext = ctx => {
  console.log(ctx['label']); // prints the stored value for that setting
  ctx['my range'] = 10; // this sets the value of the 'my range' setting to 10 in the panel
  ctx['multibox'][1] = false; // this doesn't work; you can only set top-level setting values
  ctx['multibox'] = [true, false, true]; // do this instead
  console.log(Object.entries(ctx)); // this works, even with the polyfill
};

<ControlPanel contextCb={handleContext}>...</ControlPanel>;
```

In browsers that don't support the ES6 `Proxy` API, a shallow polyfill is used which allows values to be get, set, and listed which should be enough for most applications.

Please note that you cannot use external state if you are supplying a panel context callback.

## development

To develop on this library, simply run the following commands:

- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

Then, open [localhost:9000](http://locahost:9000/) in your web browser. The page being shown is found in `/demo`, and any changes to it or the library itself will be hot-reloaded.

### building the demo for publishing

1. Change `demo.js` to `index.js` in `demo/index.html`
1. Run `cp demo/index.html dist/index.html`
1. Comment out the `externals` in `webpack.prod.js`
1. Run `yarn build demo`
1. The demo application will be built into `dist`
